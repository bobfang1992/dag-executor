# Endpoint Registry (dev environment)
# AUTO-GENERATED outputs: artifacts/endpoints.dev.json, dsl/packages/generated/endpoints.ts

# Rules:
# - endpoint_id must be unique, start with "ep_", max 64 chars, never reused
# - name must be unique (case-sensitive)
# - kind must be: redis, http
# - resolver.type must be: static (Step 14.2), consul/dns_srv/https (future)
# - All envs must have identical endpoint_id sets with matching name/kind
